 * Question 6 â€“ JMC receives output from many different programs in CSV format
 * you must write a program to display this data. You need to create a program
 * that uses an external 3rd party library to read and write data to a CSV (as
 * an example https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-read-csv-file-in-java ) this
 * data must be displayed in a GUI (a table is fine)
